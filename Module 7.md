To write a C program for array of structure to check eligibility for the vaccine person age above 6 years of age.
## Algorithm:
1.	Declare structure eligible with age (integer) and n (character array)
2.	Declare variable e of type eligible
3.	Input age and name using scanf, store in e
4.	If e.age <= 6

6.	Return 0
## Program:
```
#include <stdio.h>
struct eligible {
    int age;
    char n[50];
};

int main() {
    struct eligible e; 
    printf("Enter name: ");
    scanf("%s", e.n);
    printf("Enter age: ");
    scanf("%d", &e.age);
    if (e.age <= 6) {
        printf("Vaccine Eligibility: No\n");
    } else {
        printf("Vaccine Eligibility: Yes\n");
    }
    return 0;
}

4.	End the main function.
5.	Return 0 to indicate successful program execution.
## Program:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *p;           
    printf("Enter the file name: ");
    scanf("%s", name);
    printf("File '%s' will be created...\n", name);
    p = fopen(name, "w");
    if (p == NULL) {
        printf("Error: File could not be created.\n");
        return 1; 
    }

    printf("File '%s' has been opened successfully.\n", name);
    fclose(p);
    printf("File '%s' has been closed.\n", name);

    return 0;
}

## Ex No 5: 
C PROGRAM TO DISPLAY STUDENT DETAILS USING STRUCTURE
## Aim:
The aim of this program is to dynamically allocate memory to store information about multiple subjects (name and marks), input the details for each subject, and then display the stored information. Finally, it frees the allocated memory to prevent memory leaks.
## Algorithm: 
1.Input the number of subjects.
2.Read the integer value n from the user, which represents the number of subjects.
3.Dynamically allocate memory:
4.Use malloc to allocate memory for n subjects. Each subject has a name (array of characters) and marks (integer).
5.If memory allocation fails (i.e., the pointer s is NULL), display an error message and exit the program.
6.Input the details of each subject
7.Use a for loop to read the name and marks of each subject using scanf. For each subject, store the name as a string and marks as an integer in the dynamically allocated memory.
8.Display the details of each subject
9.Use another for loop to print the name and marks of each subject.
10.Free the allocated memory
11.After all operations are done, call free(s) to release the dynamically allocated memory.
12.Return from the main function
13.End the program by returning 0.
## Program:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct subject {
    char name[50];
    int marks;
};

int main() {
    int n, i;
    printf("Enter the number of subjects: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    struct subject *s = (struct subject *)malloc(n * sizeof(struct subject));
    if (s == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed!\n");
        return 1; 
    }
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("\nEnter the name of subject %d: ", i + 1);
        scanf("%s", s[i].name);
        printf("Enter the marks for %s: ", s[i].name);
        scanf("%d", &s[i].marks); 
    }
    printf("\n--- Subject Details ---\n");
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("\nSubject: %s\n", s[i].name);
        printf("Marks: %d\n", s[i].marks);
    }
    free(s);
    return 0;
}
